# Hackfest 2020 - The Twelve Labours of Web Coding

The challenge contained 3 main tracks.

- The first was about finding an exposed git repo and some Go challenges.
- The second was about automated deployment - I only did the first flag of this track.
- The third was about finding a hidden folder containing challenges written in Rust.

See the markdown files for details of each challenge.
